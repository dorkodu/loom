# Loom

**Loom - the Minimalist Dependency Utility for PHP**

Loom helps you automate the autoloading process (weaving, as we say :D) of (in)dependent code bundles in PHP projects.\
It's a simple CLI util written in PHP. We created it to solve autoloading problem in a simple & efficient way.\
It is minimalistic, it works offline, and on a per project basis.

See [the project website](https://libre.dorkodu.com/loom) for further knowledge and documentation.
